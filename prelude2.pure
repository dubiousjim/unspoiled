/*
  Using the existing {} for `nothing`.

  I'm now tempted to just use '{x}, '{x,y} etc for single x, pair x y.
  One downside: currently pattern-matching on {} crashes (fixed post-0.55)
                have to use `m::matrix = ... if null m` instead
  Another: should the nothing be {}---which would be continuous with '{x} and so on?
           or should it be ()---the result of void and so on?
  Another: printf and friends expect their argv sequences as tuples
           anything else in the stdlibs?
  Another: '{M,N} is a bit slower than pair M N, and you want M and N to be evaluated first
  Why '{x,y} is any better than '(x,y)?
     we have a nesting single: {x} ~= x, '{{x}} ~= {x}
     contiguously allocated
  Space:
    {1,2,3} is 3 cells
    '{1,2,3} is 4 cells (so too '{1,2,{3}})
    triple 1 2 3 is 7 cells (so too 1:2:3)
    '(1,2,3) is 9 cells
    [1,2,3] is 9 cells
