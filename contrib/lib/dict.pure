/* .. module:: dict

   Dictionaries
   ------------

   The dict.pure module provides Pure's dictionary data types based on AVL
   trees. There are actually four different types to choose from, depending on
   whether you need ordered or hashed dictionaries and whether multiple values
   for the same key should be allowed or not.

   .. type:: dict /type

      An ordered dictionary. This assumes an ordered key type, i.e., the
      predicate :func:`<` must be defined on the keys.

   .. type:: hdict /type

      A hashed dictionary which works with any (mixture of) key types but
      stores members in an apparently random order.

   .. type:: mdict /type

      An ordered dictionary, like :type:`dict/type`, which allows multiple
      values to be associated with the same key.

   .. type:: hmdict /type

      A multi-valued dictionary, like :type:`mdict/type`, but uses hashed keys
      like :type:`hdict/type`.

   .. type:: xdict /type

      This is just an abstract supertype for matching any kind of dictionary
      provided by this module.

   :type:`mdict/type` and :type:`hmdict/type` are also colloquially referred
   to as (ordered or hashed) *multidicts*. This implementation guarantees that
   different members for the same key are always kept in the order in which
   they were inserted, and this is also the order in which they will be
   retrieved by the :func:`members/dict`, :func:`keys/dict`, :func:`vals/dict`
   and indexing operations.

   The usual comparison predicates (:func:`==`, :func:`~=`, :func:`<=`,
   :func:`<` etc.) are defined on all dictionary types, where two dictionaries
   are considered "equal" (``d1==d2``) if they both contain the same
   ``key=>value`` pairs, and ``d1<=d2`` means that ``d1`` is a sub-dictionary
   of ``d2``, i.e., all ``key=>value`` pairs of ``d1`` are also contained in
   ``d2`` (taking into account multiplicities in the multidict case). Ordered
   dictionaries compare keys using equality (assuming two keys ``a`` and ``b``
   to be equal if neither ``a<b`` nor ``b<a`` holds), while hashed
   dictionaries check for syntactical equality (using :func:`===`). The
   associated values are compared using the :func:`==?` predicate.

   The underlying AVL tree data structure can be found in the avltrees.pure
   module which is included in the library, but not to be invoked directly.

   The AVL tree algorithm has its origin in the SWI-Prolog implementation of
   association lists. The original implementation was created by R. A. O'Keefe
   and updated for SWI-Prolog by Jan Wielemaker. For the original source see
   http://www.swi-prolog.org.

   The port from SWI-Prolog and the deletion stuff (:func:`rmfirst/dict`,
   :func:`rmlast/dict`, :func:`delete/dict`) missing in the Prolog
   implementation was provided by Jiri Spitz. The generalization of the code
   to arbitrary combinations of ordered/hashed and single-/multi-valued keys
   was done by Albert Graef. Dubiousjim expanded the AVL code with additional
   get and delete methods, and implementations of pick, folds, all and any. He
   also provided the alternate 2-3-Tree implementation.

   Imports
   ~~~~~~~

   To use the operations of this module, add the following import declaration
   to your program::

     using dict;

   Operations
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   .. function:: emptydict
                 emptyhdict
                 emptymdict
                 emptyhmdict

      return an empty dictionary

   .. function:: dict kvs
                 hdict kvs
                 mdict kvs
                 hmdict kvs

      create a dictionary of the corresponding type either from a list ``kvs``
      of key-value pairs in the form ``key=>value``, or from another
      dictionary; in the latter case the argument is converted to a dictionary
      of the desired target type

   .. function:: dictp d
                 hdictp d
                 mdictp d
                 hmdictp d

      check whether ``d`` is a dictionary of the corresponding type

   .. function:: mkdict v ks
                 mkhdict v ks
                 mkmdict v ks
                 mkhmdict v ks

      create a dictionary from a list of keys and a constant value

   .. function:: infix + /dict d1 d2

      sum: ``d1+d2`` adds the members of ``d2`` to ``d1``

   .. function:: infix - /dict d1 d2

      difference: ``d1-d2`` removes the members of ``d2`` from ``d1``

   .. function:: infix * /dict d1 d2

      intersection: ``d1*d2`` removes the members *not* in ``d2`` from ``d1``

   .. function:: prefix # /dict d

      size of a dictionary (the number of members it contains)

   .. function:: infix ! /dict d k

      get the value from ``d`` by key ``k``; in the case of a multidict this
      actually returns a list of values (which may be empty if ``d`` doesn't
      contain ``k``)

   .. function:: grob /dict d k

      get the value from ``d`` by key ``k``; in the case of a multidict this
      returns the oldest value

   .. function:: grob_other /dict d k

      get the value from ``d`` by key ``k``; in the case of a multidict this
      returns the newest value

   .. function:: null /dict d

      test whether ``d`` is an empty dictionary

   .. function:: member /dict d k

      test whether ``d`` contains a member with key ``k``

   .. function:: members /dict d
                 list /dict d

      list the members of ``d`` (in ascending order for ordered dictionaries)

   .. function:: keys /dict d

      list the keys of ``d`` (in ascending order for ordered dictionaries)

   .. function:: vals /dict d

      list the values of ``d``

   .. function:: first /dict d
                 last /dict d

      return the first and the last member of ``d``, respectively

   .. function:: rmfirst /dict d
                 rmlast /dict d

      remove the first and the last member from ``d``, respectively

   .. function:: pickfirst /dict d
                 picklast /dict d

      return the pair ``(first member of d, rest of d)`` or ``(last member of d, rest of d)``,
      respectively; if ``d`` is empty, return ``()`` instead

   .. function:: insert /dict d (k=>v)
                 update /dict d k v

      insert ``k=>v`` into ``d`` (this always adds a new member in a
      multidict, otherwise it replaces an existing value if there is one);
      note that :func:`update/dict` is just a fully curried version of
      :func:`insert/dict`, so ``update d k v`` behaves exactly like
      ``insert d (k=>v)``

   .. function:: delete /dict d k

      remove ``k`` from ``d`` if present (in the multidict case, only the
      first member with the given key ``k`` is removed)

   .. function:: delete_other /dict d k

      remove ``k`` from ``d`` if present (in the multidict case, only the
      last member with the given key ``k`` is removed)

   .. function:: pick /dict d k

      remove ``k`` from ``d``, and return the pair ``(v, rest of d)``, where
      ``v`` was the value associated with key ``k``; if ``k`` is not present
      in ``d``, instead return ``()`` (in the multidict case, only the first
      member with the given key ``k`` is picked)

   .. function:: pick_other /dict d k

      remove ``k`` from ``d``, and return the pair ``(v, rest of d)``, where
      ``v`` was the value associated with key ``k``; if ``k`` is not present
      in ``d``, instead return ``()`` (in the multidict case, only the last
      member with the given key ``k`` is picked)

   .. function:: delete_val /dict d (k=>v)

      remove a specific key-value pair ``k=>v`` from ``d`` if present (in the
      multidict case, only the first instance of ``k=>v`` is removed); please
      also see the notes below regarding this operation

   .. function:: delete_all /dict d k

      remove all entries with key ``k`` from ``d`` (in the non-multidict case,
      this is just the same as :func:`delete/dict`)

   .. function:: pick_all /dict d k

      remove all entries with key ``k`` from ``d``, and return the pair ``(vs,
      rest of d)``, where ``vs`` is the list of all values associated with
      key ``k``; if ``k`` is not present in ``d``, instead return ``()``

   .. function:: foldl /dict f a d
                 foldl1 /dict f d
                 foldr /dict f a d
                 foldr1 /dict f d
                 any /dict p d
                 all /dict p d

      these are equivalent to calling the corresponding list methods on
      ``members d``, but more efficient (no intermediate list is built)

   .. function:: mfoldl /dict f a d
                 mfoldl1 /dict f d
                 mfoldr /dict f a d
                 mfoldr1 /dict f d
                 many /dict p d
                 mall /dict p d

      these are like the functions ``foldl`` and so on, except that ``f``
      receives all the values associated with a given key grouped together in
      a single list; so the signature of ``mfoldl`` is::

        mfoldl (\a (k=>vs) -> ...) a d

   .. function:: filter /dict p d
                 mfilter /dict p d

      these return a dict that contains all instances of ``k=>v`` from ``d`` that
      satisfy the predicate ``p``; the first passes entries to ``p`` one-at-a-time
      (like ``foldl``), the second groups entries with the same key together
      into the form ``k=>vs`` (like ``mfoldl``)

   .. function:: partition /dict p d
                 mpartition /dict p d

      these are equivalent to ``filter p d, filter ((~).p) d`` and
      ``mfilter p d, mfilter ((~).p) d``, respectively, but more efficient

   .. note::

      * The infix operators :func:`+/dict`, :func:`-/dict` and :func:`*\/dict`
      	work like the corresponding set and bag operations (see `Sets and
      	Bags`_), treating dictionaries as collections of ``key=>val``
      	pairs. You can mix arbitrary operand types with these operations, as
      	well as with the comparison operations; the necessary conversions from
      	less general dictionary types (ordered, single-valued) to more general
      	types (hashed, multi-valued) are handled automatically.

      * The :func:`delete_val/dict` function compares values using
        coarse-grained equality (:func:`==?`). If there is more than one
        instance of the given value under the given key, the first such
        instance will be removed (which, if :func:`==` is defined on the
        values, may be any instance that compares equal, not necessarily an
        exact match).

      * In the multidict case, :func:`delete_val/dict` may require linear time
        with respect to the number of different values stored under the given
        key. Since this operation is also needed to implement some other
        multidict operations like comparisons, difference and intersection,
        these may end up requiring quadratic running times in degenerate cases
        (i.e., if the majority of members happens to be associated with only
        very few keys).

   Examples
   ~~~~~~~~

   A normal (ordered) dictionary::

     > using dict;
     > let d::dict = dict ["foo"=>77,"bar"=>99.1];
     > keys d; vals d; members d;
     ["bar","foo"]
     [99.1,77]
     ["bar"=>99.1,"foo"=>77]

   Indexing a dictionary works in the usual way, using Pure's :func:`\!`
   operator. An :cons:`out_of_bounds` exception is thrown if the key is not in
   the dictionary::

     > d!"foo";
     77
     > d!"baz";
     <stdin>, line 5: unhandled exception 'out_of_bounds' while evaluating
     'd!"baz"'

   By virtue of the prelude, slicing a dictionary with :func:`\!\!` also works
   as expected::

     > d!!["foo","bar","baz"];
     [77,99.1]

   A hashed dictionary can be used with any key values, which are stored in a
   seemingly random order::

     > let h::hdict = hdict [foo=>77,42=>99.1];
     > keys h; vals h; members h;
     [42,foo]
     [99.1,77]
     [42=>99.1,foo=>77]
     > h!foo;
     77
     > h!!keys h;
     [99.1,77]

   Multidicts work in pretty much the same fashion, but allow more than one
   value for a given key to be stored in the dictionary. In this case, the
   indexing operation returns a list of all values for the given key, which
   may be empty if the key is not in the dictionary (rather than throwing an
   :cons:`out_of_bounds` exception)::

     > let d::mdict = mdict ["foo"=>77,"bar"=>99.1,"foo"=>99];
     > d!"foo"; d!"baz";
     [77,99]
     []

   Slicing thus returns a list of lists of values here::

     > d!!["foo","bar","baz"];
     [[77,99],[99.1],[]]

   To obtain a flat list you can just concatenate the results::

     > cat $ d!!["foo","bar","baz"];
     [77,99,99.1]

   Hashed multidicts provide both key hashing and multiple values per key::

     > let h::hmdict = hmdict [foo=>77,42=>99.1,42=>77];
     > keys h; vals h; members h;
     [42,42,foo]
     [99.1,77,77]
     [42=>99.1,42=>77,foo=>77]
     > h!42;
     [99.1,77]

   There are also some set-like operations which allow you to add/remove the
   members (``key=>val`` pairs) of one dictionary to/from another dictionary,
   and to compute the intersection of two dictionaries. For instance::

     > let h1 = hmdict [a=>1,b=>2];
     > let h2 = hmdict [b=>2,c=>3];
     > members (h1+h2);
     [a=>1,c=>3,b=>2,b=>2]
     > members (h1-h2);
     [a=>1]
     > members (h1*h2);
     [b=>2]

   It's possible to mix dictionaries of different types in these operations.
   The necessary conversions are handled automatically::

     > let h1 = hmdict [a=>1,b=>2];
     > let h2 = hdict  [b=>3,c=>4];
     > members (h1+h2);
     [a=>1,c=>4,b=>2,b=>3]

   Note that the result will always be promoted to the most general operand
   type in such cases (a hashed multidict in the above example). If this is
   not what you want, you'll have to apply the necessary conversions
   manually::

     > members (hdict h1+h2);
     [a=>1,c=>4,b=>3]
