=========

Libraries and stuff for [pure-lang](http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/).

The `contrib` folder is a sandbox for contributions I'm making to the Pure distribution.

The rest are things I'm working on, or are provided here just for the random interested browser.

 *   macros/try.pure -- try/succeeds/finally macros (NEW)
 *   macros/gfolds.pure -- gfold-writing macros (NEW)
 *   macros/walker.pure -- walks and converts a Pure syntax tree, used by gfolds.pure (NEW)
 *   macros/common.pure -- some common macro operations

 *   hashtable.pure -- mutable hashtable
 *   prelude2.pure -- miscellaneous extra bits and pieces

Experiments, of mixed success:

 *   experiments/delimcc.pure -- delimited continuations (shift/reset), only works in some cases
 *   experiments/functor.pure -- ML-style functors in pure
