unspoiled
=========

Libraries and stuff for [pure-lang](http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/).

The `contrib` folder includes things I've contributed to the Pure distribution:

 *   trees23.pure -- rewrite of lib/avltrees.pure
 *   nonsplicing.pure -- non-splicing vector braces
 *   msort.pure -- an optimized stable mergesort for lists

I plan some further developments for trees23, but hopefully everything will get merged into the standard distribution.

The toplevel includes things I'm working on, or are provided here just for the random interested browser.

 *   try.pure -- try/succeeds/finally macros
 *   lists.pure -- additional list methods
 *   weakdict.pure -- weak references, and weak-key and weak-value dicts (this may also be merged into the standard distribution)
 *   hashtable.pure -- mutable hashtable
 *   functor.pure -- ML-style functors in pure
 *   prelude2.pure -- miscellaneous extra bits and pieces
